```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(colorspace)
library(cowplot)
opts_chunk$set(fig.align="center", fig.height=4, fig.width=5.5)

Load the data from STL reporting and DPG reporting and compare
```{r message = FALSE}
STL_spemd <- read_csv("data\\STL_funding_levels.csv")
STL_spend
```

```{r message=FALSE}
# examine colums; plot over time
six_degrees <- c(
  "Psychology", 
  "Communications technologies", 
  "Engineering", "Business", 
  "Education", 
  "Architecture and related services"
  )

# plot these degrees over time and display percentage of total
STL |>
  filter(field %in% six_degrees) |>
  mutate(perc = perc * 100) |> # transform column values
  mutate(field = fct_reorder(field, perc, max)) |>  # reorder by largest per pane
  ggplot(aes(year, perc)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(
    vars(field), 
    ncol = 2, 
    labeller = label_wrap_gen()
    ) +
  labs(
    y = "percentages amongst all fields of study"
  )

It looks like the differences in the datasets are not too disparate; attributing
most of this too snapshot in time, whether before or after a key decision; 
trends are the same.  Will use DPG data to have less friction in future discussions.
